Double Hashing: H(k,i) = (H(k) + iD(k)) mod h, where i=0,1,...,h-1

Question 4
1st slot:
H(k,0) = 21 mod 11 = 10
--> slot 10

2nd slot:
H(k,1) = (10 + 7) mod 11 = 6
--> slot 6

3rd slot:
H(k,2) = (10 + 2*7) mod 11 = 2
--> slot 2


Question 5
1st slot:
H(k,0) = 19 mod 11 = 8
--> slot 8

2nd slot:
H(k,1) = (8 + (5-7)) mod 11 = 6
--> slot 6

3rd slot:
H(k,2) = (8 + 2(5-7)) mod 11 = 4
--> slot 4
